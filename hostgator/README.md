# Design & Code collaboration via git with Sketch
A repo to test-drive design+code collaboration with Sketch where the core .sketch data is pushed/pulled to/from the repo only.

# Initial Setup
1. `git clone https://github.com/zweiland/hg-dls-collab.git`
2. `cd hg-dls-collab`
3. `sh download.sh`
4. `open .`
5. in Finder open design-system-hostgator.sketch

# Set up your own design repo
For a more detailed explanation of the thinking and working of the scripts, please see [this blog post](https://blog.blended.io/how-to-use-sketch-with-git-the-right-way/)

# What do the scripts do
`upload.sh`
1. Pull the latest changes from the repo
2. Copy .sketch to .zip
3. Extract the core `.sketch` data from the .zip and delete it
4. Remove the preview image (only full size images will be added to the index)
5. Add the core data to the git index
6. Commit and push the data

Please note that the .sketch file is itself will not be versioned. The file would only clog the repo and reduce speed.

`download.sh`
1. Pull the latest changes from the repo
2. Zip the core Sketch data
3. Copy .zip to .sketch and delete .zip

Now you can open the .sketch file with Sketch.app
